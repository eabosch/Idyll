Strange Woman: Where are my manners? I'm Annie.

Annie: I am glad for a new neighbor, honest. You just caught me a bit unawares.
->Apologize for the trouble ma'am
    Annie: You're awfully kind. It was no trouble at all.
    
    Annie: Are you the new tenant at that old farm?
    
    Annie: Sort of a dreary place, no?
->It's no trouble, ma'am. I Understand.
    Annie: Good, good. Would be a shame if I left a poor impression on my new neighbor.
    
    Annie: If you haven't yet, you should take a short preamble around these  woods.
    
    Annie: My favorite method of clearing my mind. And the birdsong is so pleasant.
