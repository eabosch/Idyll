''Strange Woman:'' ...hello.

''Strange Woman:''  A new face... that's rare.

-> It's nice to meet you, ma'am

    Strange Woman: Where are my manners? I'm Annie.
    Annie: I am glad for a new neighbor, honest. You just caught me a bit unawares.
        ->Apologize for the trouble ma'am
            Annie: You're awfully kind. It was no trouble at all.
            Annie: Are you the new tenant at that old farm?
            Annie: Sort of a dreary place, no?
                ->Not at all. I enjoy the peace and quiet.
                ->A little. But it's good to have neighbors.
        ->It's no trouble, ma'am. I Understand.
            Annie: Good, good. Would be a shame if I left a poor impression on my new neighbor.
            Annie: If you haven't yet, you should take a short preamble around these  woods.
            Annie: My favorite method of clearing my mind. And the birdsong is so pleasant.
