I'm Annie.\r\n    Annie: I am glad for a new neighbor, honest. You just caught me a bit unawares.\r\n        ->Apologize for the trouble ma'am\r\n            Annie: You're awfully kind. It was no trouble at all.\r\n            Annie: Are you the new tenant at that old farm?\r\n            Annie: Sort of a dreary place, no?\r\n                ->Not at all. I enjoy the peace and quiet.\r\n                ->A little. But it's good to have neighbors.\r\n        ->It's no trouble, ma'am. I Understand.\r\n            Annie: Good, good. Would be a shame if I left a poor impression on my new neighbor.\r\n            Annie: If you haven't yet, you should take a short preamble around these  woods.\r\n            Annie: My favorite method of clearing my mind. And the birdsong is so pleasant.\r\n",
